# string-calculator-java6-pbt

The String Calculator kata completed using a recursive descent parser with property based tests.  I was keen to try and complete this kata using property based tests to see what the tests would look like without lambdas - suprisingly the result was good.  If you view the code inside IntelliJ it'll even render the code so that it looks like a lambda - nice and compact.
